## Practice 2 of Video Coding: Python and video

### Parts

**Exercise 1:** Create a python script able to parse the ‘ffmpeg–i BBB.mp4’ file, which can mark at least 3 relevant data from the container.

**Exercise 2:** Create a python script able to rename the 5 quality outputs of the BBB that you did in last seminar.

**Exercise 3** Create a python script able to resize (resolution change) of any input given.

**Exercise 4:** Create a python script able to transcode the input into an output with another codec that we’ve seen in the Theory class.

**Exercise 5:** Integrate some or all the previous exercises into one script, which allows you to choose which variables of the input video you’d like to change.

### Code

This code uses the ffmpeg package for python. It is necessary to have the Big Buck Bunny video as BBB.mp4 to execute it.

Change the option in the ```choose_exercise()``` function to select a task from 1 to 4 or 0 to exit.
